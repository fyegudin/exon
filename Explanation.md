Bonus 1: To include the "priority" field, need to extend the
logic in calculate_total_grade to consider the priority.

Bonus 2: To handle the delay in new website appearances, 
you might want to introduce a mechanism to simulate the passage
of time. For instance, you can add a timestamp field to the
websites and update it periodically based on the elapsed time
since the last update. The calculate_total_grade function can
then consider this timestamp when computing the seniority parameter. Keep in mind that this is a simulation,
and in a real-world scenario, need to use a scheduler (change the time)
or a time-based trigger in your database system.

If you have more time to improve the project, there are several aspects you can consider:

1. **Unit Testing:** Enhance your unit tests to cover more edge cases and scenarios. Make sure to test different combinations of parameters and prioritize the tests based on critical functionality.

2. **Integration Testing:** Consider creating integration tests that cover the interaction between different components of your system. For example, you can simulate the full process of updating the ranking, from inserting new products to updating the ranking table.

3. **Refactor and Code Quality:** Review your code for any areas that can be refactored to improve readability and maintainability. Ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices.

4. **Logging:** Expand logging in your application. Ensure that log messages are helpful for debugging and troubleshooting. You can log more details during critical processes or when exceptions occur.

5. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms. Make sure that your application gracefully handles unexpected situations and provides meaningful error messages.

6. **Documentation:** Enhance code documentation, including docstrings for functions and classes. Document any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies. Consider using a documentation tool like Sphinx to generate documentation from docstrings.

7. **Performance Optimization:** If you identify performance bottlenecks, consider optimizing critical sections of your code. Use profiling tools to identify areas that can be improved, and apply appropriate optimizations.

8. **Security Considerations:** Review your code for potential security vulnerabilities. Ensure that you are handling user inputs securely, validating data, and protecting against common security issues.

9. **Scalability:** Consider how your application might scale as the data volume increases. Optimize database queries, and explore options for caching or database indexing if necessary.

10. **Code Review:** If you are working in a team, conduct code reviews to get feedback from other developers. Code reviews can help identify potential issues, ensure consistency, and share knowledge among team members.

11. **Automated Build and Deployment:** Implement automated build and deployment processes. This can include using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment workflows.

12. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing and deployment of your application. This ensures that changes are automatically validated and deployed in a controlled manner.

13. **Version Control:** Ensure that your project is well-versioned using a version control system like Git. This helps in tracking changes, collaborating with others, and rolling back to previous versions if needed.

14. **User Interface (if applicable):** If your project has a user interface, consider improving the user experience by enhancing the UI design, providing clear instructions, and handling user inputs more gracefully.

15. **Accessibility:** Ensure that your application is accessible to users with disabilities. Follow best practices for web accessibility (WCAG) if applicable.

Remember to prioritize improvements based on the specific needs and goals of the project. Continuous improvement is an ongoing process, and each enhancement should bring tangible benefits to the project and its users.
